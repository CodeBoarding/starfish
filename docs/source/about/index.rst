About
=====

Starfish is developed and maintained by the Science team at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
It began as a project to support the SpaceTx consortium, an effort to benchmark image based transcriptomic methods by applying 10 different methods on a common tissue source, standardizing the raw data formats and using standardized analysis pipelines.

SpaceTx Consortium
------------------

The SpaceTx consortium is a group led by Ed Lein and the Allen Institute for Brain Science that
is engaged in benchmarking image-based transcriptomics assays. In collaboration with the lead
developers of 10 image-based transcriptomics assays, they are applying each technology to adjacent
sections of mouse and human primary visual cortex. The goal of this experiment is to understand
what assay(s) are best applied to (a) spatially localizing cells by type based on marker genes and
(b) obtaining robust phenotypes of cells by measuring RNA from thousands of genes.

Consortium members include:

- Ed Boyden, MIT
- Long Cai, Caltech
- Fei Chen, Broad Institute
- Karl Dieserroth, Stanford
- Ed Lein, Allen Institute for Brain Science
- Sten Linnarrson, Karolinska Institutet
- Joakim Lundeberg, SciLifeLab
- Jeffrey Moffit, Harvard
- Mats Nilsson, SciLifeLab
- Aviv Regev, Broad Institute
- Anthony Zador, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
- Kun Zhang, University of California San Diego
- Xiaowei Zhuang, Harvard
